      <title>The U.S. Says it Will “Run” Venezuela. What Will That Mean?</title>

The president gave few details and no specific time frame, saying only that the U.S. would “run the country” until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be arranged. U.S. oil companies would return to Venezuela, investing “billions and billions” of dollars to reboot the oil sector and the country’s economy. American “boots on the ground” might be deployed in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a remarkable series of statements from a president who has criticized past American nation-building projects, and it raised questions about how exactly the Trump Administration would “run” a country beset by profound challenges. Venezuela, a country twice the size of Iraq, has endured decades of authoritarian rule, corruption, drug-related violence, and economic pain. And for the moment at least, the country’s leader still pledges allegiance to Maduro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miguel Tinker Salas, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; historian, Professor Emeritus at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona_College" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Pomona College&lt;/a&gt; and Fellow at the Quincy Institute, said that when Trump spoke those words – “we’re gonna run it” – he was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, my jaw dropped,” Salas told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “Even at the height of U.S. influence in Venezuela, in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, they never said they wanted to run the country. And I don't think the Trump administration comprehends the complexity that they're dealing with for a country as diverse and as big as Venezuela.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even those who cheered the U.S. military operation warned of the difficulties that lie ahead. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who pronounced himself “delighted” by Maduro’s ouster, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e7HABk-Ji0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; NewsNation the mission was “maybe step one of a much longer process. Maduro is gone but the regime is still in place.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maduro’s fall is good for Venezuela and the United States,” Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RHFontaine/status/2007514907143467380" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;posted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on X. “It was a brilliant military operation and the world should be better off because of it. Whether it WILL in fact be better off depends on what happens next. One of the lessons of other regime-change operations is not to topple a government without a plan for what comes next. What comes next in Venezuela seems as vague as the plan for running postwar Gaza under a ‘Board of Peace’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embed-related"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Venezuelans who might lead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a news conference following Maduro’s capture, Trump said that Delcy Rodriguez, the regime’s vice president, would lead Venezuela as long as she “does what we want.” And he suggested the U.S. would enforce that arrangement at the barrel of a gun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” Trump &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/loud-noises-heard-venezuela-capital-southern-area-without-electricity-2026-01-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adding that the U.S. might deploy “a second wave” of forces if Venezuelan officials or troops don’t go along with Washington’s wishes. The U.S. naval presence near Venezuela remains in place – the largest such deployment in the region since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;painted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a slightly different picture of the U.S. role. “It’s not running — it’s running policy, the policy with regards to this,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rubio and Trump were clear about the overall approach: in essence, &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do what we say, and things will be fine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to make decisions based on their actions and their deeds in the days and weeks to come,” Rubio&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “We think they’re going to have some unique and historic opportunities to do a great service for the country, and we hope that they’ll accept that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear that Rodriguez, the former Vice President, will be a pliant ally. She was sworn in Monday as interim president, after almost immediately accusing the U.S. of invading her country on Saturday. She &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-maduro-only-president.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;called&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the operation “a barbarity,” and in an address to the nation said that Maduro was still Venezuela’s head of state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolás Maduro Moros,” Rodriguez &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-maduro-only-president.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with other senior officials at her side. Venezuela, she said, would never agree to being a U.S. "colony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day later she &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-acting-president-seeks-us-govt-collaboration-2026-01-05/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;struck&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a less defiant note, calling on the U.S. to work with her government on an “agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development.” She added that “we prioritize moving towards balanced and respectful international relations between the United States and Venezuela."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not at all clear that’s what Trump has in mind; he insisted that Rodriguez would comply with his wishes – one way or another. "She had a long conversation with Marco [Rubio], and she said, 'We'll do whatever you need,'” Trump said. “I think she was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice.” On Sunday he upped the ante, &lt;a href="http://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;telling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that if Rodriguez “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said Rodriguez will have to navigate an almost impossible political tightrope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She claims to represent a socialist party opposed to U.S. intervention and to U.S. meddling in her internal affairs – so how does she rationalize this to her base?” Salas said. “This is a very difficult, challenging position for her to be in – to on the one hand promise social change reforms, a continuation of Maduro, and at the same time, now become compliant in providing oil to the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="horizontal-rule"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

They have denounced Maduro’s abduction as well – Padrino &lt;a href="https://mazo4f.com/en/padrino-lopez-the-countrys-military-forces-are-united-and-cohesive-in-the-face-of-imperial-aggression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vowed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to resist “the most criminal military aggression” and ordered a mobilization of Venezuelan forces on land, sea, and air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned of splits within the army – between hardliners who may refuse to support anyone who bows to Trump’s demands, and others who will stand with Rodriguez no matter what. Such divides could lead to violence and – if Trump is true to his word – a deployment of U.S. “boots on the ground.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Shifter, a former president of the Inter-American Dialogue, said that while Rodriguez might be able to deliver on Trump’s demands to open up the oil sector, other critical tasks will prove more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be exceedingly difficult if not impossible for her to tame the entrenched corruption and widespread criminality in the country while leaving the machinery of Chavista governance intact,” Shifter told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, using a term for policies begun by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez. “The risks that chaos, violence and instability will ensue are high, and under that scenario the U.S. would have no choice but to send in troops to stabilize the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Control of the military is essential for control of Venezuela, particularly in this unstable moment,” Salas said. “And so far, the commanding general of the military, Padrino, has shown no disposition to break with the PSUV [Maduro’s party].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent in the Trump plans for now is any role for the Venezuelan opposition. The main opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last month, issued a statement urging that her political ally, Edmundo Gonzalez, be recognized as Venezuela’s president. Gonzalez was widely seen as the rightful winner of the 2024 presidential vote. “Today we are prepared to enforce our mandate and take power,” Machado &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/trump-venezuela-leader-rodriguez-machado.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in his news conference after Maduro’s capture, Trump never mentioned Gonzalez, and threw cold water on the prospects of a role for Machado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader," Trump &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "She doesn't have the support or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those remarks left Machado in the odd position of having won her goal of Maduro’s exit, while failing to win the backing of Washington. Salas said Venezuelans he had spoken with “were disillusioned about the fact that Trump essentially threw her under the bus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked Saturday which American officials would “run” Venezuela, Trump nodded to Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who flanked the president during his news conference. “The people that are standing right behind me, we’re going to be running it,” Trump &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That drew a rebuke from Elliott Abrams, a Senior Fellow for the Council on Foreign Relations and longtime hawk in terms of U.S. policy in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venezuelans wanted Maduro out and voted against him,” Abrams &lt;a href="https://link.cfr.org/click/43359392.4336/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2ZyLm9yZy9leHBlcnQtYnJpZWYvYXNzZXNzaW5nLXZlbmV6dWVsYXMtZnV0dXJlLWFmdGVyLW5pY29sYXMtbWFkdXJvcy1ib2xkLWNhcHR1cmU_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1kYWlseWJyaWVmJnV0bV9jb250ZW50PTIwMjYwMTA1/5deac970fc942d4a17cc4f78Bd4ae29de" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the organization’s website. “They did not vote for U.S. rule, and pursuing that path will create instability—exactly what Trump does not want.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The oil factor &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the months-long runup to Maduro’s capture, as the U.S. deployed naval forces to the Caribbean and attacked alleged drug traffickers from the air, the Trump administration justified its actions by invoking the drug trade and the illegitimacy of Maduro’s rule. Oil was rarely mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as U.S. officials explain their post-Maduro plans, oil is front and center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Trump accused Venezuela of seizing U.S. oil assets in the country, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/rubio-military-quarantine-venezuela-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; U.S. companies would return to operate Venezuela’s state-controlled oil reserves, “spend billions of dollars” and “start making money for the country.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil companies have a &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long history&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Venezuela, dating to the early 20th century, when they came at the government’s invitation to explore and develop oil reserves. Gulf, Shell, and Standard Oil were among the early arrivals, in what proved to be a symbiotic relationship: the companies earned billions of dollars, and Venezuela grew rich; by the mid-1970s, oil revenues had helped make it the wealthiest nation, per capita, in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1976, Venezuela nationalized its oil industry, creating a state-owned company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), that continued to partner with foreign companies. More than two decades later, President Hugo Chavez &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/chavez-drives-exxon-and-conocophillips-from-venezuela-idUSN26378950/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;renegotiated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contracts with foreign oil companies to boost Venezuela’s share of the profits, a move that prompted ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips to leave the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Venezuela’s oil sector and its broader economy suffered the consequences – a deteriorating oil infrastructure, and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and the PDVSA. Today, Venezuela &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Venezuelan_oil_industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;produces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fewer than one million barrels of oil a day, down from roughly 3.5 million in 1997, and more than &lt;a href="http://v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;90 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Venezuelans live in poverty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venezuela has been a problem both for the United States and for the Venezuelan people for over 20 years,” Paul Kolbe, a former Director of The Intelligence Project at Harvard University’s Belfer Center, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “For the Chavez years and then the Maduro years, they've driven a country that was once one of the wealthiest in the world, and certainly the wealthiest in South America…into the ground through corruption, poor leadership, poor decisions, and oppression of the people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one U.S. oil company – Chevron – has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/world/americas/trump-venezuela-chevron-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;remained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Venezuela, operating under joint ventures with the PDVSA. Rubio’s and Trump’s remarks suggest that the U.S. intends to force Rodriguez, the interim leader, to offer favorable conditions to other American companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts aren’t sure the others will return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali Moshiri, who oversaw Chevron’s operations in Venezuela until 2017, said the big oil firms won’t go back until they clear signs of change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not many companies are going to rush to go into an environment where there’s not stability,” Moshiri &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/business/energy-environment/venezuela-oil-us-chevron.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;He also said that while Chevron and smaller operators could boost the country’s oil output slightly in the short term, a more robust expansion would take years, given the political situation, the state of the country’s oil infrastructure, and the time needed to reestablish operations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salas echoed the point. “Exporting oil from Venezuela is a challenge,” he told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; “The infrastructure has collapsed. The oil itself that has to be pumped out of the ground is heavy crude, which requires a lot of technology, and billions of dollars of investment. So I'm not convinced that American companies are going to be running in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="horizontal-rule"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube? There is no better place to get clear perspectives from deeply experienced national security experts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="horizontal-rule"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A long history of regime change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maduro mission came exactly 36 years after the surrender of another Latin American dictator – Panama’s Manuel &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Noriega&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to face drug charges in the U.S. That operation had its detractors, but in the history of U.S. regime-change missions, it probably counts as a relative success story. The list of other cases is long – and while each episode had its own specific history, there have been few good outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take three very different examples: The 2003 decapitation of the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq – which involved a huge force of “boots on the ground” – was celebrated initially by President George W. Bush in a &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/uncategorized/20-year-retrospective-reflecting-on-the-mission-accomplished-speech-and-its-aftermath/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“Mission Accomplished”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; speech, only to unravel in a fierce domestic insurgency that lasted for years, cost more than 4,000 American lives, and led – indirectly – to the rise of the Islamic State. The Kennedy administration backed a coup against South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963; Diem was later murdered, unrest followed, and in his memoirs, President Lyndon Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/17/archives/memoir-terms-kennedy-role-in-diem-coup-a-blunder-book-terms-diem.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blamed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the coup for the escalation of the Vietnam War. In Iran, the nationalization of the oil industry was at the heart of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;coup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated by the U.S. and Britain in 1953 to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. That led to the return to power of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – and ultimately to the revolution that brought an Islamic theocracy to power in Tehran in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I immediately am reminded of Iraq, where the military operation was well done and we removed Saddam Hussein pretty quickly in 2003, but then what came after was not great,” Glenn Corn, a former CIA Senior Executive, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “So I hope we've learned that lesson and we're not going to repeat the mistakes we made there.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salas noted that one lesson of the Iraq War involved the perils of driving out the remnants of an ousted regime. “The lesson learned in Iraq was when they attempted to expunge the Ba’ath Party, they realized that they had utter chaos because there was no one there to run the government, no one with experience,” he said. “You had the nation fracture into particular sections, regions, strongmen, military individuals, and others. If that happened in Venezuela, it would be chaotic. The country's very big, very diverse. It has oil regions, it has urban areas, it has an industrial base. So you could imagine that happening on a national scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To some, the Maduro operation was reminiscent of an earlier era of American “gunboat diplomacy,” when the U.S. military was deployed regularly to seize territory and resources. The &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;David Sanger noted that Trump installed a portrait of William McKinley in the White House – and it was President McKinley who presided over the U.S. seizures of the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. operation, in seeking to assert control over a vast Latin American nation, has little precedent in recent decades,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-venezuela-oil-risks.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sanger wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “recalling the imperial U.S. military efforts of the 19th and early 20th centuries in Mexico, Nicaragua and other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What comes next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the uncertainties of the moment, experts said the next phase in Venezuela will hinge on answers to several core questions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the Trump administration have an arrangement with Rodriguez and other Maduro regime officials to do the White House’s bidding? If not, how will the U.S. respond if they fail to oblige? Does the U.S. have a plan to remove those leaders? What might trigger that “second wave” Trump referred to, and the deployment of U.S. forces to the country? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What milestones must be met for the end of the interim period? Would elections follow – and would the U.S. organize or oversee those? What will the major U.S. oil companies do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uncertainties abound in Venezuela about what comes next,” Shifter said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“For now, a framework of coerced cooperation between the Venezuelan regime, now led by Delcy Rodriguez, and the Trump administration, seems to be in effect. But it is far from clear whether that model is viable, much less sustainable.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fontaine said that “the default could well be to work with a compliant President Delcy and most of the existing government. It would be a head of state change more than regime change.” But he added that such an arrangement would do little to satisfy the opposition – the same people who have cheered the news of Maduro’s capture. “Many would-be supporters of this move hoped for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, not just a different approach on drugs and oil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that Trump was hardly the first president to decry nation-building projects, only to wind up taking them on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For 25 years, every U.S. president has opposed nation-building abroad and then gotten involved in it,” Fontaine said. “Trump, with the commitment to run Venezuela, appears to be the latest. The welcome fall of Maduro is not the end, or the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more expert-driven national security insights, perspective and analysis in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thecipherbrief.com/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; because National Security is Everyone’s Business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are a lot of different accounts and issues that must be taken into consideration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela’s partners depend on it for various strategic reasons: &lt;strong&gt;Cuba&lt;/strong&gt; for economic support, &lt;strong&gt;Iran&lt;/strong&gt; for political alignment in Latin America, and &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt; for a notable share of its oil imports. The United States, meanwhile, is signaling a major shift in how it intends to assert influence in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief Executive Editor Brad Christian talked with Roule, a leading global consultant on Middle East and Energy issues, about what is likely to happen next as the U.S. signals a major shift in how it intends to assert influence in the Western Hemisphere.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="horizontal-rule"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="horizontal-rule"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: The Trump administration recently released an updated &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;national security strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; that weighed heavily on the Western hemisphere. Are we seeing perhaps the first kind of inclination that this is going to actually be something to pay close attention to?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. And I think the national security strategy is something that every one of the Cipher Brief's readers and listeners should pull out today. Look at it again, because I can assure you that policymakers around the world - in both our partner and adversary countries - are certainly doing so. If you look at events in Venezuela and read that national security strategy, a number of themes come forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will be the dominant power in the Western hemisphere. In Venezuela, we saw a display of massive U.S. power and skill in the form of our military intelligence and technology. This is very similar to the display that the world witnessed in &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next" target="_self"&gt;Iran last June&lt;/a&gt;. So, this is coming very, very close to two sets of actions. And I think this is meant to be seen also, as the president alluded to in his press conference, as a visible reset of what he described as a previous erosion of U.S. military power in his predecessor's administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also showing that the U.S. is now capable of executing what was described by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as an extraordinarily large and complicated military and intelligence operation, without being leaked. This did not require foreign partners. And it also did not require the disruption of regional commercial air operations. If you listen to what the chairman talked about, this involved 150 aircraft from multiple locations descending upon another country. And other than closing the airspace for a short period of time, commercial air traffic was not disrupted. But you're seeing some other things that are also notable. The U.S. will undertake regime change when it perceives that the existing regime threatens core U.S. national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also represents another U.S. blow against a Chinese partner in the Western hemisphere following the Trump administration's actions in &lt;a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/international-relations-security/why-panama-canal-president-trumps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;. The operation also took place on the anniversary of the killing of Iranian Quds Force leader General &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/soleimani-and-the-true-measure-of-deterrence" target="_self"&gt;Qassem Soleimani&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 as well as the surrender of &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-3/noriega-surrenders-to-u-s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Manuel Noriega&lt;/a&gt; in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are both examples of the long arm of the U.S. government. And certainly, the United States may have thought that the selection of this date would dampen any commemorations by the Iranian government for Soleimani's death in Tehran. Which would have been difficult enough given the &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/irans-protests-expose-deeper-fragility-as-leaders-struggle-to-contain-crisis" target="_self"&gt;ongoing demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; in Tehran. But the ripples from this Venezuela operation will be global. And I think the national security strategy puts some meat on the bone with this operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embed-related"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: Just looking at the intelligence that was needed to pull off an operations like this for a moment, what do you think this says about U.S. intelligence and what would have gone into that for this particular operation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it tells you a couple of things. It tells you that first, the intelligence was exquisite and up to date. But it also tells you that the intelligence was integrated into the military operation with an intimacy, with care, so that our military personnel were able to move with extraordinary speed to get to the location as quickly as humanly possible. We've seen this in the past with the operation against Osama bin Laden. This is just another example of the close integration between the U.S. intelligence communication and our amazing and extraordinary special forces personnel. I can't speak highly enough of those extraordinary and humble operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also shows you the breadth of that intelligence community. The intelligence agencies that were cited included, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). So, you're getting a sense of some very broad intelligence capabilities which were brought to bear and then integrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president, I believe, also mentioned that a house had been built in advance. I mean, you're just watching some incredible intelligence capability that was brought to bear by people on the ground over many months. It shows courage, it shows tenacity, it shows you the resources that were pulled together. And it also shows an ability to compartment this information and to prevent a leak. The U.S. government is doing what it's supposed to do. And in a world where we're often complaining about government, the American people and our partners should be gratified that our tax dollars are being well spent. And that the U.S. intelligence community and the military are performing superbly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="horizontal-rule"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a daily dose of reality on national and global security issues?

As an energy expert, can you share what’s top of mind for you on the broader impact on the oil and energy markets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe the best way to answer that is to just explain a little bit about the Venezuelan oil system. First, the operation did not occur near Venezuelan oil production. Upstream oil operations are not located near Caracas, although exports and storage are highly sensitive to obviously, as you correctly put it, a U.S. maritime enforcement of a U.S. embargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Venezuela's oil production, about two thirds, is derived from what is known as the Orinoco belt. And oil production from this &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-31/venezuela-oil-output-slows-25-in-orinoco-belt-under-us-pressure" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Orinoco belt&lt;/a&gt; had fallen to about 498,000 barrels by the end of December, which is about a 25% drop from just a couple of weeks earlier. And it's been shutting down because they're running out of storage space because Venezuela can't export oil because of the blockade. So, they're trying to put the oil anywhere they can. They've put it in their own storage, they've put it in ships that are docked. They're putting it in almost in teacups at this point because they are running out of space to store the oil that they're producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the oil that is produced in Venezuela. They produce it from tar sands. It's extra heavy. It's a heavy type of crude oil and there are relatively few refineries that can process this grade of oil. It's difficult to extract. It's expensive to extract. Chinese refineries in 2025 tended to get a majority of Venezuelan exports. That amount ranged from 75 to 90% depending upon the amount. But even here, the Chinese tended to put much of that oil in their own storage. And China and Russia tend to be the two big players in Venezuela. For China, it is transactional. Chinese buyers look at it as a way to purchase cheap oil that they again put in storage. It's about 4% of China's exports and China again, has used a shadow fleet of intermediaries to purchase this oil. If China were to lose access to this, it's a problem. But because much of this has gone into storage and there are other suppliers out there in Saudi Arabia and other places, they could make this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's a different story. Russia is an enabler of the Venezuelan oil industry. Because Venezuela's oil is so tar heavy, in essence, they need to import &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/naphtha" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;naphtha&lt;/a&gt; from Russia and this dilutes the ore and eco output and makes it blendable and then shippable. So, Russia sends in naphtha, it blends the stuff down and then stuff can then be exported. What would happen if suddenly Venezuela is opened up? Well, a couple of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, because the oil market is relatively well supplied, people would look at it and ask, ‘where are the investment opportunities?’ If you look at the places where the world has changed suddenly and investment opportunities occurred, production didn't dramatically change. Let's take Iraq and Libya for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iraq, it took about a dozen years to get back to the level of pre-Saddam. And at that point, China was a major player. The U.S. is now returning to Iraq. In Libya, we're now a number of years after the fall of Gaddafi, and they are still about 25% below production levels under Gaddafi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And again, the U.S. is returning. Much of it does depend upon the security of the country and the stability of the country. So, the president's comments about running Venezuela the right way really does strike at the heart of what happens in the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: Devil’s Advocate here: how does it compete with Texas’ output? What does the U.S. do with that oil? Is it going to be sold to China?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The president and the Secretary of State have talked about stolen oil. What does this refer to? Is there a U.S. case there? I'll leave it to others to talk about the amounts and so forth but when this is talked about, this refers to a 2007 Venezuela expropriation of what I believe was then Conoco Phillips or ExxonMobil investments. That Venezuela did indeed expropriate. So, there is indeed a legal case of Venezuela nationalization of U.S. assets for which the U.S. was not compensated. If Venezuela's government did change and if U.S. oil companies were to go in, could the oil industry be dramatically changed? Yes, but it would depend upon security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe my final comment would be that Chevron has been heavily invested there, and they have maintained a very mature and stable outlook for the country. If you hear Chevron’s CEO speak about Chevron's investments, they've been very levelheaded and unflappable about national security events. So, I think you're going to see them stay there as well. And I think when you listen to the president's comments about how the U.S. would run Venezuela, he seemed fairly confident that the U.S. oil industry would play a role there. Which makes one think that there have been some sort of discussions in this regard playing out in some way in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief: At the most recent &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tcbconference.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cipher Brief Threat Conference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, there was a lot of discussion around the idea of global conflict and some people believe that we are at the precipice of World War III. Certainly everyone agrees that global disruption is at fairly unprecedented levels. What is your thinking on this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roule:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We are in a different world, but we're in a world of permanent &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/how-can-the-u-s-better-manage-the-gray-zone" target="_self"&gt;gray zone conflict&lt;/a&gt;. But gray zone is defined and very, very differently. Gray zone was once defined by Iranian militias and it was defined by drone attacks or cyberattacks that were non-attributed. But we now have drone attacks or drone flights in Europe that come from God knows where, but they're Russian. We have Chinese routine harassment for more than a decade in the South China Sea. We have routine theft of intellectual property by China and North Korea, which in and of itself is a type of attack against our economy. But it's not necessarily a traditional gray zone attack. Because the people who are often involved in gray zone operations only see a certain number of colors on the palate. But the theft of intellectual property is just another form of attack.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're in that kind of a world and the people who are running the countries, they don't need to launch a war per se. They need to launch a series of short, sharp conflicts. Or short, sharp attacks. Now they said these could lead to a war if people believe we don't care about certain areas. And I do think there is the issue of what could happen in Taiwan in 2026. That should be a worry for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you Subscribed to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV_DhOZPmrM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief’s Digital Channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; on YouTube?

It was a very dangerous operation. It was amazing that we had a few injured, but all are in good shape right now, but I knew there was great danger. You got off a helicopter. The helicopters were being shot out. They got on the ground amazing talent and tremendous patriotism, bravery. The bravery was incredible…They got off the helicopter and the bullets were flying all over the place. As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but that we got everything back. Got everything back and nobody killed,” meaning Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-speaks-with-reporters-aboard-air-force-one/671169" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;speaking Sunday&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aboard Air Force One on the way back from Florida about what he observed watching the early Saturday morning &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-maduro-2026" target="_self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. raid in Caracas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embed-related"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While events in &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/venezuela-was-a-surprise-what-could-be-next" target="_self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are still unfolding and I will discuss some below, I use that quote because it illustrates that deaths of American service members is one thing I believe is high in Trump’s mind as he has in recent months undertaken a series of worldwide military actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump almost regularly points out that no Americans have been killed in the four months the U.S. has been blowing up &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/caribbean-double-tap-counternarcotics-strike" target="_self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alleged narco-trafficking boats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. No Americans were lost in the &lt;a href="https://www.thecipherbrief.com/experts-assess-strikes-response-and-what-comes-next" target="_self"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bombing of Iran nuclear facilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite Trump’s threat that he could put U.S. boots-on-the-ground if needed to “run” Venezuela, there is no immediate indication he has plans to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it appears Trump’s plan is to “run” Venezuela using what remains of the corrupt Maduro military/police hierarchy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/05/trump-demands-venezuela-leader-00711728" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as long as they do what Trump wants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Crawford, who in the past had been assigned to represent defendants captured by the Coast Guard, who said the killing of crew members without prosecution amounted to very dangerous “political theater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could say the same today for what I consider today’s ill-thought-out Trump actions in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="horizontal-rule"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What national security news are you missing today?

He then went on to say, "I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader. &lt;a href="https://time.com/7343295/venezuela-machado-trump-nobel-peace-prize/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;She doesn't have the support or the respect within the country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She's a very nice woman but she doesn't have the respect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I believe Trump meant was that the Maduro power structure – the Venezuelan Army, Bolivarian National Police and urban paramilitary networks known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;colectivos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; -- remain active and it is they that don’t “respect” Machado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also probably the reason there are no U.S. boots-on-the-ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Trump seems to believe that by keeping major U.S. military forces near Venezuela, he can threaten additional military attacks to keep the ex-Maduro crowd in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Trump put it Sunday on Air Force One, “Venezuela thus far has been very nice, but it helps to have a force like we have. You know, we were ready for a second wave. We were all set to go, but we don't think we're going to need it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently it is Venezuela’s oil which is primarily on Trump’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other matters, Trump seems to be living in the past as illustrated when he told reporters over the weekend, “We [the U.S.] had a lot of oil there [in Venezuela]. As you know they threw our companies out, and we want it back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationalization was the culmination of a decades-long effort by Venezuelan administrations of both the right and the left to bring under government control an industry that an earlier leader had largely given away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil, which merged in 1999, and Gulf Oil, which became Chevron in 1984, were hit hardest. The Dutch giant Shell was also affected. The companies, which had accounted for more than 70 percent of crude oil production in Venezuela, lost roughly $5 billion in assets but were compensated just $1 billion each, according to news stories from that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Trump said, “The oil companies are ready to go. They're going to go in, they're going to rebuild the infrastructure. You know, we built it to start off with many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took it away. You can't do that. They can't do that with me. They did it with other presidents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to several sources, major oil companies &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/business/venezuela-trump-oil-chevron" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are not eager&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to spend the years and money at the present time to revive the Venezuelan oil industry, but as with much about the Venezuelan situation, there’s little yet that is predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potentially dangerous outcome, looming already, is how Trump reads what he so far considers his military success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday he made &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/venezuela-live-updates-trump-give-details-after-us?id=127792811&amp;amp;entryId=128901259&amp;amp;userab=abc_web_player-460*variant_b_abc_dmp-1901%2Cotv_web_player-461*variant_b_otv_dmp-1903%2Cotv_web_content_rec-445*variant_c_trending-1851%2Chp_banner-426*variant_a_control-1777&amp;amp;userab=abc_web_player-460*variant_b_abc_dmp-1901%2Cotv_web_player-461*variant_b_otv_dmp-1903%2Cotv_web_content_rec-445*variant_a_control-1849%2Chp_banner-426*variant_a_control-1777" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;open threats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to both Colombia and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called Colombian President Gustavo Petro “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States. And he's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for Cuba, Trump said, “Cuba always survived because of Venezuela. Now, they won't have that money coming in. They won't have the income coming in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then went on to point out, “You know, a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday. You know that. A lot of Cubans were killed…There was a lot of death on the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Trump quickly added, as I have pointed out before, “No death on our side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who's reading this? 500K+ dedicated national security professionals.
